## Overview
As requested, the following metrics have been removed from all UI grids, tabs, and companies:
- Total Conversations
- New Conversations

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Components Updated ✅
The following React components have been updated to remove conversation metrics:

#### Marketing Components:
- `/components/marketing/ChannelGrid.tsx` - Removed conversations section
- `/components/marketing/MetricsGrid.tsx` - Removed conversation totals and section
- `/components/marketing/WeeklyMetricsGrid.tsx` - Removed conversation totals and section

#### Paid/SEO Components:

- `/components/SEOChannelGrid.tsx` - Removed conversation and avg appointment revenue metrics

### 2. Database Changes (Action Required) ⚠️
SQL script created to remove columns from database tables:
- Script location: `/scripts/remove-conversation-metrics.sql`

**Tables to be modified:**
- `executive_monthly_reports` - Remove: total_conversations, new_conversations, returning_conversations
- `executive_weekly_reports` - Remove: total_conversations, new_conversations, returning_conversations
- `paid_ads` - Remove: total_conversations, new_conversations, returning_conversations, avg_appointment_rev, conversation_rate
- `seo_channels` - Remove: total_conversations, new_conversations, returning_conversations, avg_appointment_rev, conversation_rate

### 3. Migration Scripts Updated ✅
- Created `/scripts/migrate-paid-ads-seo-updated.js` - New migration script that excludes conversation metrics
- The script now only migrates the following fields:
  - clinic, month, traffic_source, campaign (paid_ads only)
  - impressions, visits, spend (paid_ads only)
  - total_appointments, new_appointments, returning_appointments
  - appointment_est_revenue, new_appointment_est_6m_revenue
  - appointment_rate, ctr

### 4. Helper Scripts Created ✅
- `/scripts/check-columns-to-remove.js` - Checks which columns exist in tables
- `/scripts/test-ui-changes.js` - Tests if UI changes are working correctly

## Action Required

### 1. Run SQL Script in Supabase
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and run the contents of `/scripts/remove-conversation-metrics.sql`
4. This will remove all conversation-related columns from the database

### 2. Verify Changes
After running the SQL script:
1. Run `node scripts/test-ui-changes.js` to verify columns are removed
2. Visit the application and check all tabs display correctly
3. Ensure no errors appear in the console

2. UI component changes can be reverted through git
3. Database columns would need to be re-added manually
