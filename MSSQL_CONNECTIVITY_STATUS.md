# MSSQL Connectivity Status Update

## 🚨 Current Status: MSSQL Server Unreachable

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issue**: MSSQL server at `54.245.209.65:1433` is currently unreachable

### Test Results
- ❌ **Ping Test**: 100% packet loss
- ❌ **Port Test**: Connection timeout on port 1433
- ❌ **MCP Server**: Cannot connect to MSSQL database

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The MSSQL server appears to be:
1. **Temporarily down** for maintenance
2. **Blocked by firewall** - IP restrictions may have changed
3. **Requiring VPN** - Network access may have changed
4. **Server moved** - IP address may have changed

## ✅ What's Working

### MCP Servers Setup ✅
- **Supabase MCP Server**: Fully configured and ready
- **MSSQL MCP Server**: Configured and ready (when server is accessible)
- **Documentation**: Complete guides created
- **Startup Scripts**: Automated server management ready

### Supabase Database ✅
Your Supabase database is well-structured with:
- `companies` table for company data
- `scorecards_metrics` table for metric definitions
- `scorecards_weekly` table for weekly data
- Optimized indexes and views
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates

## 🛠️ Immediate Actions

### 1. Monitor Server Status
```bash
# Test MSSQL connectivity
ping -c 3 54.245.209.65
nc -zv 54.245.209.65 1433

# Test MCP server when available
./scripts/start-mcp-servers.sh status
```

### 2. Use Supabase for Development
Since your Supabase database is ready, you can:
- Continue development using Supabase data
- Test your application with existing data
- Prepare for when MSSQL becomes available

### 3. Alternative Data Sources
Consider these options:
- **CSV Import**: Import data from CSV files to Supabase
- **API Integration**: Connect to other data sources
- **Manual Data Entry**: Add test data for development

## 📊 Current Supabase Schema

Your Supabase database has these tables:

### `companies`
- `id`, `company_name`, `display_name`, `is_active`
- Stores company information

### `scorecards_metrics`
- `id`, `metric_code`, `display_name`, `category`, `unit_type`, `format_type`
- Defines metrics and their display properties

### `scorecards_weekly`
- `id`, `company_id`, `metric_id`, `year`, `week_number`, `value`, `trending_value`
- Stores weekly metric data with trending information

## 🔄 When MSSQL Returns

Once the MSSQL server is accessible again, you can:

### 1. Test Connection
```bash
# Test basic connectivity
ping 54.245.209.65

# Test MCP server
./scripts/start-mcp-servers.sh start
./scripts/start-mcp-servers.sh status
```

### 2. Sync Data
Use the MCP servers to sync data from MSSQL to Supabase:

```sql
-- Extract from MSSQL
SELECT * FROM [aggregated_reporting].[dbo].[ceo_report_full_week]
WHERE [Week_Ending] = '2024-01-07';

-- Transform and insert into Supabase
INSERT INTO scorecards_weekly (company_id, metric_id, year, week_number, value)
SELECT 
    c.id as company_id,
    sm.id as metric_id,
    YEAR(Week_Ending) as year,
    DATEPART(week, Week_Ending) as week_number,
    Metric_Value as value
FROM mssql_data md
JOIN companies c ON md.Company_ID = c.company_name
JOIN scorecards_metrics sm ON md.Metric_Name = sm.metric_code;
```

## 📋 Action Items

## 📞 Support Contacts

If the MSSQL server remains unavailable:
1. **Check with your network team** about VPN requirements
2. **Contact the database administrator** about server status
3. **Verify IP whitelist** if you're accessing from a new location

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Continue development** using Supabase
2. **Monitor MSSQL status** regularly
3. **Prepare data sync scripts** for when MSSQL returns
4. **Test MCP servers** as soon as connectivity is restored
