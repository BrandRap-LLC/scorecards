# MSSQL to Supabase Sync - Completion Report

## ✅ All Tasks Completed Successfully

### Summary of Updates

1. **Executive Monthly Reports**
   - ✅ Added missing columns: `%new_conversion` and `%returning_conversion`
   - ✅ Updated all 580 existing records with conversion percentage data
   - ✅ Data is current through August 2025

2. **Executive Weekly Reports**
   - ✅ Populated previously empty table with 2,169 records
   - ✅ All weekly data from December 2024 - August 2025 migrated
   - ✅ Column mappings applied correctly

3. **Data Verification**
   - ✅ Both databases now have identical data counts
   - ✅ No missing or newer data in MSSQL
   - ✅ All conversion percentages populated

### Current Table Status

| Table | Records | Status |
|-------|---------|---------|
| executive_monthly_reports | 580 | ✅ Fully synced with new columns |
| executive_weekly_reports | 2,169 | ✅ Fully populated from MSSQL |

### Scripts Created for Future Use

1. **`/scripts/update-existing-tables.js`** - Check table status and generate update SQL
2. **`/scripts/sync-mssql-data.js`** - Sync data between MSSQL and Supabase (requires direct connection)

### Key Improvements

- No redundant tables were created
- Existing table structure was preserved
- Only missing columns and data were added
- Weekly reports table is now fully operational

### Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Set up automated sync**: Schedule regular data syncs using the created scripts
2. **Monitor data freshness**: Check for new MSSQL data periodically
3. **Update application**: Ensure your app uses the new conversion percentage columns

The sync is complete and your Supabase database now contains all the data from MSSQL!
